#Tank Test
This is a class project with  2 tanks that can drive and show collision with hitbox boundaries.
##How to start the game
Boot the ConsoleApp1.sln file and select the green start arrow in the project.
(I wasn't able to convert my game into an exe)
###How to play
Player one is controlled with WASD or movement and Space for shooting a bullet(still a work in progress on the bullet)
Player two is controlled with num8456.

Both tanks and the bullet have a green hitbox that will turn red on contact.
